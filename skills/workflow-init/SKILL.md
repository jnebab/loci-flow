# Workflow Init

Sets up the compounding loop in the current directory:

**recall → think → plan → review → build → compound → map**

Each task starts with a budget-capped knowledge-graph query (recall), ends by
capturing verified learnings (compound) and folding them into the graph (map),
so the next task starts smarter. rtk compresses all shell output in between.

Works on a single repo or a workspace folder containing multiple repos
(rules live at the top level and cover every session beneath it).

## Prerequisites (check, don't assume)

| Tool | Check | Install |
|---|---|---|
| rtk | `rtk --version` | macOS: `brew install rtk` · Windows/Linux: prebuilt binary from github.com/rtk-ai/rtk releases, or `cargo install rtk` |
| graphify | `graphify --version` | `pip install graphifyy` (double-y; the single-y PyPI package is unrelated). Windows: `py -m pip install graphifyy` |

Process skills (brainstorming, systematic-debugging, writing-plans, TDD,
verification) come from the superpowers plugin if installed; the loop rules
reference them but do not require them.

## Steps — confirm each with the user before writing

1. **CLAUDE.md** — append the loop rules from
   `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/workflow-init/references/claude-md-template.md`
   (append if the file exists — NEVER overwrite; adjust the plan-review line
   to whatever visual-review tool the user has, e.g. lavish).
2. **docs/solutions/ scaffold** — create `{bug,decision,gotcha,pattern}/`
   subdirectories and copy
   `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/workflow-init/references/solutions-readme.md`
   to `docs/solutions/README.md`.
3. **.claudeignore** — MUST contain `graphify-out/` BEFORE any extraction.
   Skipping this invalidates the prompt cache on every graph rebuild and
   silently erases the workflow's token savings.
4. **rtk hook (project-scoped, NOT global)** — merge the contents of
   `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/workflow-init/references/settings-hook.json`
   into `.claude/settings.json` (create it if absent; if it exists, add the
   PreToolUse entry to the existing hooks). Do NOT run `rtk init -g` — it
   edits the user's global `~/.claude/settings.json`. Plain `rtk init` may
   also append a ~145-line command reference to CLAUDE.md; the template's
   compact RTK section replaces that, so skip `rtk init` entirely.
   Verify: run `rtk git status` inside a repo, then `rtk gain`.
5. **graphify graphs** — ask the user which code targets to graph (never
   extract everything unprompted). Then per target:
   `graphify extract <target> --code-only --out graphify-out/targets/<name>`
   — local tree-sitter AST, zero LLM tokens, so repos stay clean of
   generated files.
   For `docs/solutions/` markdown (needs a semantic LLM pass): with
   `GEMINI_API_KEY` set use `graphify extract docs/solutions --backend gemini
   --out graphify-out/targets/docs-solutions`; without a key, run the
   graphify skill's subagent extraction with the session model — never block
   on an API key.
   Merge everything into the default query graph:
   `graphify merge-graphs graphify-out/targets/*/graphify-out/graph.json --out graphify-out/graph.json`
6. **Verify end-to-end (the pass/fail gate)** — write or copy one learning
   into `docs/solutions/`, map it (step 5's semantic pass + remerge), then
   `graphify query "<its topic>" --budget 1000` must retrieve its root
   cause/fix. Not verified = not done.

## Keeping the graph current

- Code changed in a graphed repo: `graphify update <repo>` (free, no LLM),
  then remerge.
- Learning added/updated: re-run the docs semantic pass (the extraction
  cache skips unchanged files), then remerge.

## Rules

- Everything project-scoped: no edits to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` or
  `~/.claude/settings.json`. If `graphify install` is used for its query
  skill, move `~/.claude/skills/graphify` into `<project>/.claude/skills/`
  and revert the section the installer appends to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` —
  both rtk and graphify installers default to global mutation.
- Small fresh repos: skip graphify until learnings accumulate (its own
  benchmarks show ~1x payoff on tiny corpora); do steps 1-4 only.
- Do not add always-on context injectors (persona rulesets, per-turn style
  packs) or lossy ML compression proxies to this workflow — they either tax
  every turn or risk silently degrading answers. rtk is lossless-by-rule;
  graphify's recall is budget-capped; that is the whole point.
- Windows note: the hook command (`rtk hook claude`) is shell-agnostic as
  long as `rtk` is on PATH; paths in commands use forward slashes.
