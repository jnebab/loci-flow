## The compounding loop (every task)

1. **Recall first.** Before exploring code or docs for any non-trivial task,
   run `graphify query "<topic>" --budget 2000` from the workspace root.
   It searches past learnings (docs/solutions/) and the code graph in one
   budget-capped call. Only fall back to grep/Read exploration for what the
   query didn't answer.
2. **Think → plan → build** per your skill routing: brainstorming for
   features, systematic-debugging for bugs, writing-plans for multi-step
   work, and a visual review of plans before execution.
3. **Visual when visual.** Whenever the user asks to explain, visualize,
   compare, or walk through something — or the answer is easier grasped
   as a diagram/table/comparison than prose — ask one question: interactive
   HTML, or markdown? HTML → render via lavish (`npx -y lavish-axi <file>`),
   then poll for annotations. Markdown → apply the `i-have-adhd` skill if
   installed, plus `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/init-loci/references/markdown-output.md`
   (its rules alone carry this path if `i-have-adhd` isn't installed).
   Applies to plan reviews (step 2) and standalone explanations alike;
   don't answer in prose what's clearer drawn or structured.
4. **Compound last.** After solving anything non-obvious, run /compound.
   Learnings live in docs/solutions/{bug,decision,gotcha,pattern}/ — check
   there before re-debugging anything.
5. **Map after compounding.** After /compound writes or updates an entry,
   re-run the docs semantic pass (extraction cache skips unchanged files;
   working dir graphify-out/targets/docs-solutions), then remerge:
   `graphify merge-graphs graphify-out/targets/*/graphify-out/graph.json --out graphify-out/graph.json`
   After code changes in a graphed repo: `graphify update <repo>` (free,
   no LLM), then the same remerge.
6. **Handoff closes the loop.** After a task or bugfix is verified
   complete (steps 4–5 done if the session produced a learning), run
   `/handoff` to record real gate output, real commit hash, and what's
   next for the following session. Also runnable manually anytime the
   user wants to wrap up or leave a note ("wrap up", "leave a note for
   next time") — it does not require compound/map to have run first.

## Workspace facts

- graphify-out/ is machine-generated (and .claudeignore'd) — never read it
  directly; use `graphify query` / `graphify explain`.
- Visual graph map: `/viz [target]` generates/opens the interactive
  community visualization for a graphed target (graphify cluster-only +
  `label --backend=claude-cli` under the hood). Offer it when the user asks
  to "see" the codebase structure, communities, or how things connect;
  >5000 nodes → suggest `graphify tree` instead.

## RTK (token-optimized command output)

A PreToolUse hook (.claude/settings.json) auto-rewrites Bash commands
through `rtk`, compressing git/test/lint/build output 60-90% — no action
needed. If the hook is unavailable, prefix commands with `rtk` manually
(safe passthrough for unknown commands). Meta: `rtk gain` (savings stats),
`rtk discover` (missed opportunities), `rtk proxy <cmd>` (bypass filter).
